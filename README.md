Donations
----------

 - Many people have asked me for donations, but I rather code for fun and releasing
   extensions that the users want. Everything I do is OpenSource and I enjoy it
   to be that way because this is how I learned Software Development. 
 - I decided to place a PayPal donation link here, so if you would like to donate
   to support my Open Source development, you can visit the PayPal donations link
   here http://goo.gl/Mr2vX
